# 1 / 4 JSON PATH in Kubernetes
Welcome! Let's start slow and we will begin with easy viewing exercises and then move on to building JSON PATH queries.

In the given data, what is the data type of the root element?

Hint:
The root element is the top most object in a JSON document. Look at the encapsulation. Is it square brackets [] or curly brackets {} ? If it's square brackets its an array/list. If its curly brackets it is a dictionary.
